## Authentication

> To authorize, use this code:

<%= partial('examples/GET_shell', locals: { without_revision: true }) %>

<%= partial('examples/GET_javascript', locals: { without_revision: true }) %>

> Make sure to replace `<%= current_page.data.api_token_placeholder %>` with the API key.

WaniKani uses your secret API token to authenticate requests to the API. You can get and manage your v2 token in [Settings / Account](https://www.wanikani.com/settings/account#public-api-key) on WaniKani. The token __has__ to be included with every request, and should be delivered in a HTTP header that looks like:

`Authorization: Bearer <%= current_page.data.api_token_placeholder %>`

Also note that all requests must be made over HTTPS. Any requests made over HTTP or without authentication headers will fail.

You must replace <code><%= escape_html(current_page.data.api_token_placeholder) %></code> with the your API key.
