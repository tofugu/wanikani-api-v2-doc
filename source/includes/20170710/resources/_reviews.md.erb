# Reviews

Reviews log all the correct and incorrect answers provided through the 'Reviews' section of WaniKani. Review records are created when a user answers all the parts of a subject correctly once; some subjects have both meaning or reading parts, and some only have one or the other. Note that reviews are *not* created for the quizzes in lessons.

## Review Data Structure

> Example Structure

```json
{
  "id": 534342,
  "object": "review",
  "url": "<%= current_page.data.api_root_url %>/reviews/534342",
  "data_updated_at": "2017-12-20T01:00:59.255427Z",
  "data": {
    "created_at": "2017-12-20T01:00:59.255427Z",
    "assignment_id": 32132,
    "spaced_repetition_system_id": 1,
    "subject_id": 8,
    "starting_srs_stage": 4,
    "ending_srs_stage": 2,
    "incorrect_meaning_answers": 1,
    "incorrect_reading_answers": 0
  }
}
```

Attribute | Date&nbsp;Type | Description
--------- | --------------- | -----------
`assignment_id` | Integer | Unique identifier of the associated [assignment](#assignments).
`created_at` | Date | Timestamp when the review was created.
`ending_srs_stage` | Integer | The SRS stage interval calculated from the number of correct and incorrect answers, with valid values ranging from `1` to `9`
`incorrect_meaning_answers` | Integer | The number of times the user has answered the meaning incorrectly.
`incorrect_reading_answers` | Integer | The number of times the user has answered the reading incorrectly.
`spaced_repetition_system_id` | Integer | Unique identifier of the associated [spaced_repetition_system](#spaced-repetition-systems).
`starting_srs_stage` | Integer | The starting SRS stage interval, with valid values ranging from `1` to `8`
`subject_id` | Integer | Unique identifier of the associated [subject](#subjects).

### Notes

#### Incorrect Answers

A subject (radical, kanji, vocabulary, and kana_vocabulary) may not require a meaning or reading. Therefore attributes `incorrect_meaning_answers` and `incorrect_reading_answers` will return a value of `0` for subjects which do not have the requirement.

Subject type           | Answer types allowed
---------------------- | --------------------
kana_vocabulary        | Meaning
kanji                  | Meaning, Reading
radical                | Meaning
vocabulary             | Meaning, Reading

#### Spaced Repetition System

The associated spaced repetition system is the system used to do the SRS stage calculations at the time the review record was created. It does not necessarily mean it is the current `spaced_repetition_system` associated to `subject`. This is done to preserve history.

Creates a review for a specific `assignment_id`. Using the related `subject_id` is also a valid alternative to using `assignment_id`.

Some criteria must be met in order for a review to be created: `available_at` must be not null and in the past.

When a review is registered, the associated `assignment` and `review_statistic` are both updated. These are returned in the response body under `resources_updated`.

### HTTP Request

`POST <%= current_page.data.api_root_url %>/reviews/`

### Allowed Parameters

Name | Data Type | Required? | Description
---- | --------- | --------- | -----------
`assignment_id` | Integer | true | Unique identifier of the assignment. This or `subject_id` must be set.
`subject_id` | Integer | true | Unique identifier of the subject. This or `assignment_id` must be set.
`incorrect_meaning_answers` | Integer | true | Must be zero or a positive number. This is the number of times the meaning was answered **incorrectly**.
`incorrect_reading_answers` | Integer | true | Must be zero or a positive number. This is the number of times the reading was answered **incorrectly**. Note that subjects with a `type` or `radical` do not quiz on readings. Thus, set this value to `0`.
`created_at` | Date | false | Timestamp when the review was completed. Defaults to the time of the request if omitted from the request body. Must be in the past, but after `assignment.available_at`.
