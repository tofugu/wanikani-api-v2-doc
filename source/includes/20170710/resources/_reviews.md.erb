# Reviews

Reviews log all the correct and incorrect answers provided through the 'Reviews' section of WaniKani. Review records are created when a user answers all the parts of a subject correctly once; some subjects have both meaning or reading parts, and some only have one or the other. Note that reviews are *not* created for the quizzes in lessons.

## Review Data Structure

> Example Structure

```json
{
  "id": 534342,
  "object": "review",
  "url": "<%= current_page.data.api_root_url %>/reviews/534342",
  "data_updated_at": "2017-12-20T01:00:59.255427Z",
  "data": {
    "created_at": "2017-12-20T01:00:59.255427Z",
    "assignment_id": 32132,
    "subject_id": 8,
    "starting_srs_stage": 4,
    "starting_srs_stage_name": "Apprentice IV",
    "ending_srs_stage": 2,
    "ending_srs_stage_name": "Apprentice II",
    "incorrect_meaning_answers": 1,
    "incorrect_reading_answers": 0
  }
}
```

Attribute | Date&nbsp;Type | Description
--------- | --------------- | -----------
`assignment_id` | Integer | Unique identifier of the associated [assignment](#assignments).
`created_at` | Date | Timestamp when the review was created.
`ending_srs_stage_name` | String | The [stage name](#srs-stage-intervals) associated with the `ending_srs_stage`.
`ending_srs_stage` | Integer | The SRS stage interval calculated from the number of correct and incorrect answers, with valid values ranging from `1` to `9`
`incorrect_meaning_answers` | Integer | The number of times the user has answered the meaning incorrectly.
`incorrect_reading_answers` | Integer | The number of times the user has answered the reading incorrectly.
`starting_srs_stage_name` | String | The [stage name](#srs-stage-intervals) associated with the `starting_srs_stage`.
`starting_srs_stage` | Integer | The starting SRS stage interval, with valid values ranging from `1` to `8`
`subject_id` | Integer | Unique identifier of the associated [subject](#subjects).

### Notes

A subject (radical, kanji, and vocabulary) may not require a meaning or reading. Therefore attributes `incorrect_meaning_answers` and `incorrect_reading_answers` will return a value of `0` for subjects which do not have the requirement.

Subject type | Answer types allowed
------------ | --------------------
kanji        | Meaning, Reading
radical      | Meaning
vocabulary   | Meaning, Reading

Creates a review for a specific `assignment_id`. Using the related `subject_id` is also a valid alternative to using `assignment_id`.

Some criteria must be met in order for a review to be created: `available_at` must be not null and in the past.

When a review is registered, the associated `assignment` and `review_statistic` are both updated. These are returned in the response body under `resources_updated`.

### HTTP Request

`POST <%= current_page.data.api_root_url %>/reviews/`

### Allowed Parameters

Name | Data Type | Required? | Description
---- | --------- | --------- | -----------
`assignment_id` | Integer | true | Unique identifier of the assignment. This or `subject_id` must be set.
`subject_id` | Integer | true | Unique identifier of the subject. This or `assignment_id` must be set.
`incorrect_meaning_answers` | Integer | true | Must be zero or a positive number. This is the number of times the meaning was answered **incorrectly**.
`incorrect_reading_answers` | Integer | true | Must be zero or a positive number. This is the number of times the reading was answered **incorrectly**. Note that subjects with a `type` or `radical` do not quiz on readings. Thus, set this value to `0`.
`created_at` | Date | false | Timestamp when the review was completed. Defaults to the time of the request if omitted from the request body. Must be in the past, but after `assignment.available_at`.
