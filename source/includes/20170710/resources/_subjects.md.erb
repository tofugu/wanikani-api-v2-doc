# Subjects

Subjects are the radicals, kanji, and vocabulary that are learned through lessons and reviews. They contain basic dictionary information, such as meanings and/or readings, and information about their relationship to other items with WaniKani, like their level.

## Subject Data Structure

The exact structure of a subject depends on the subject type. The available subject types are `radical`, `kanji`, and `vocabulary`. Note that any attributes called out for the specific subject type behaves differently than the common attribute of the same name.

### Common Attributes

Attribute | Data Type | Description
--------- | --------------- | -----------
`auxiliary_meanings` | Array of objects | Collection of auxiliary meanings. See table below for the object structure.
`characters` | String | The UTF-8 characters for the subject, including kanji and hiragana.
`created_at` | Date | Timestamp when the subject was created.
`document_url` | String | A URL pointing to the page on wanikani.com that provides detailed information about this subject.
`hidden_at` | Date | Timestamp when the subject was hidden, indicating associated assignments will no longer appear in lessons or reviews and that the subject page is no longer visible on wanikani.com.
`lesson_position` | Integer | The position that the subject appears in lessons. Note that the value is scoped to the level of the subject, so there are duplicate values across levels.
`level` | Integer | The level of the subject, from `1` to `60`.
`meaning_mnemonic` | String | The subject's meaning mnemonic.
`meanings` | Array of objects | The subject meanings. See table below for the object structure.
`slug` | String | The string that is used when generating the document URL for the subject. Radicals use their meaning, downcased. Kanji and vocabulary use their characters.
`spaced_repetition_system_id` | Integer | Unique identifier of the associated [spaced_repetition_system](#spaced_repetition_systems).

#### Meaning Object Attributes

Attribute | Data Type | Description
--------- | --------------- | -----------
`meaning` | String | A singular subject meaning.
`primary` | Boolean | Indicates priority in the WaniKani system.
`accepted_answer` | Boolean | Indicates if the meaning is used to evaluate user input for correctness.

#### Auxiliary Meaning Object Attributes

Attribute | Data Type | Description
--------- | --------------- | -----------
`meaning` | String | A singular subject meaning.
`type` | String | Either `whitelist` or `blacklist`. When evaluating user input, whitelisted meanings are used to match for correctness. Blacklisted meanings are used to match for incorrectness.

### Markup highlighting

One or many of these attributes can be present in `radical`, `kanji`, and `vocabulary`:

* `meaning_mnemonic`
* `reading_mnemonic`
* `meaning_hint`
* `reading_hint`

The strings can include a WaniKani specific markup syntax. The following is a list of markup used:

* `<radical></radical>`
* `<kanji></kanji>`
* `<vocabulary></vocabulary>`
* `<meaning></meaning>`
* `<reading></reading>`

    "meaning_mnemonic": "This radical consists of a single, horizontal stroke. What's the biggest, single, horizontal stroke? That's the ground. Look at the <radical>ground</radical>, look at this radical, now look at the ground again. Kind of the same, right?",
    "slug": "ground",
    "spaced_repetition_system_id": 2
  }
}
```

Attribute | Data Type | Description
--------- | --------------- | -----------
`amalgamation_subject_ids` | Array of integers | An array of numeric identifiers for the kanji that have the radical as a component.
`characters` | String or `null` | Unlike kanji and vocabulary, radicals can have a null value for `characters`. Not all radicals have a UTF entry, so the radical must be visually represented with an image instead.
`character_images` | Array of objects | A collection of images of the radical. See table below for the object structure.

#### Character Image Object Attributes

Attribute | Data Type | Description
--------- | --------------- | -----------
`url` | String | The location of the image.
`content_type` | String | The content type of the image. Currently the API delivers `image/png` and `image/svg+xml`.
`metadata` | Object | Details about the image. Each `content_type` returns a uniquely structured object.
